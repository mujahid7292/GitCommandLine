    "    <li>To see all of the file & folder in the current working directory type <b>ls -la</b>. You will see a folder named “.git”.</li>\n",
    "    <li>If we want to stop tracking this project by git. We will type <b>rm -rf .git</b>. Here rm = remove; rf = reference; .git = folder. This rm -rf FOLDER/FILE is windows command. This command permanently delete file from the machine.</li>\n",
    "    <li>If any point in time we want to see the status, type <b>git status</b>.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Sometimes there is some file in our project which we don’t want to track. For those type of file, we can create “touch .gitignore” file. Inside .gitignore file we will type the name of the file which we don’t want to track, Example: add “GitTutorial.txt” into .gitignore file.</li>\n",
    "    <li>If there is untracked file, we can add those all file to track by <b>git add -A</b>. But if we want to add one file at a time we can by <b>git add calc.py</b>. For files which we cannot add by <b>git add Git Tutorial.docx</b>. We will add those file by <b>git add -A</b>.Reason that we cannot add those file because there is space in the file name. This command will not work git add Git Tutorial.docx, but this one will <b>git add GitTutorial.docx</b>. </li>\n",

    "    <li>If we want to clone some repository from the github, type <b>git clone https://github.com/Marjanam/Web-app.git .</b> Here after url dot (<b>.</b>) means we want to clone the project into the current directory.</li>\n",

    "    <li>Always run <b>git pull origin master</b> before pushing your code base to remote repository. As we are working on the project & making change, some other folks also working on the other feature of the project. So to avoid conflict we will first pull repository then push. Push command=> <b>git push origin master</b></li>\n",
